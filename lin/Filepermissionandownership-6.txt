Imagine The Linux City has a vast archive room, and every item in this room—every file and folder—is secured by a set of meticulous security rules. This system is called File Permissions and Ownership.
👑 The Owners: The User and The GroupEvery single file in the Linux archive has two primary security stamps:1. The Individual Owner (User)This is the Creator or the Designated Custodian of the file (e.g., "Alice").Rule: Only the owner can change the file's permissions or decide who else can access it.The Command: To change the individual owner, the powerful Root user (or the current owner using limited commands) uses chown (Change Owner). For instance, sudo chown bob important_report.txt.2. The Team Owner (Group)This is the Club or Team (e.g., "Developers") that also has special access to the file.Rule: Any member of this team shares the same access rights to the file.The Command: To change the team owner, you use chgrp (Change Group). For instance, sudo chgrp development important_report.txt.
🔒 The Locks: Permissions (Read, Write, Execute)For every file, the owner sets three types of locks, which dictate what action can be taken on that item. These locks are often summarized by the letters r, w, and x.Permission LockSymbolWhat it Means for a FileWhat it Means for a DirectoryReadrYou can look inside (view the contents).You can list the files inside the folder.WritewYou can modify or delete the file.You can create, rename, or delete files within the folder.ExecutexYou can run the file (if it's a program/script).You can enter the directory (traverse it).
🚪 The Access Lanes: The Three CategoriesThese three locks (rwx) are applied separately to three distinct categories of people accessing the file. This creates the three "access lanes" for every item:u (User): The individual owner.g (Group): Any member of the team owner.o (Other): Everyone else in the Linux City who is not the owner and not in the group.The Full Security StringWhen you list a file, you see a long string like this: -rwxr-xr-- , which is read as:PartDescriptionInterpretation-File Type (A hyphen means it's a regular file)rwxUser (Owner) permissionsThe owner can Read, Write, and Execute.r-xGroup permissionsThe group can Read and Execute, but cannot Write.r--Other permissionsEveryone else can only Read, but cannot Write or Execute.
🔨 The Tool: chmod (Change Mode)The command used to change these locks is chmod (Change Mode). It can use two methods:1. Symbolic Notation (Letters)Used for easy, specific changes:chmod g+w filename.txt: Grant the Group Write access.chmod o-r filename.txt: Remove Other's Read access.2. Octal Notation (Numbers)Used for quick, absolute settings. Each permission (r, w, x) is represented by a number (4, 2, 1), and the sum sets the access level for a category:PermissionValueread4write2execute1None0To give the Owner rwx (7), the Group r-x (5), and Other r-- (4), the command is:$$chmod\ 754\ filename.txt$$This rigorous system of Ownership and Permissions ensures that resources are shared efficiently among teams while maintaining strict security for individual files and the stability of the entire Linux City archive.
