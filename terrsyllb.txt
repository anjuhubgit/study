1. Terraform Fundamentals & Core Concepts:

    Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
    Understand the principles and benefits of managing infrastructure through code.
    Terraform's Purpose & Workflow:
    Grasp why Terraform is used, its role in IaC, and the write-plan-apply workflow.
    HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL):
    Learn the syntax for defining resources, variables, outputs, and modules.
    Terraform Providers:
    Understand how providers integrate Terraform with various cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) and other services. 

2. Terraform CLI & Commands:

    Core Commands: Master init, plan, apply, destroy, refresh, validate, fmt.
    Advanced Commands: Explore taint, import, graph, and state manipulation commands. 

3. Configuration & Language Features:

    Variables: Learn to use input, output, and local variables for flexible configurations.
    Expressions & Functions: Understand string interpolation, loops (for_each, count), and conditional expressions.
    Dynamic Blocks: Create dynamic configurations using conditional logic and iteration. 

4. State Management & Backends:

    Terraform State: Understand its role in tracking infrastructure changes.
    Remote State Backends: Learn to use remote storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage) for collaborative and secure state management.
    State Locking: Implement mechanisms like DynamoDB for state locking to prevent concurrent modifications. 

5. Modules & Reusability:

    Terraform Modules: Understand how to create and use reusable modules for organizing and standardizing configurations.
    Terraform Registry: Leverage pre-built modules for common infrastructure patterns.
