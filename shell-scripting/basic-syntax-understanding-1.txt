basic syntax, understanding
Once upon a time in the silicon kingdom of Kernel-Land, there lived a messenger named Script. Script wasn't very smart on his own, but he was excellent at following a list of instructions written on a piece of parchment.

To make sure these instructions were executed perfectly, Script followed a very specific set of traditions.

1. The Royal Seal: The Shebang (#!/bin/bash)
Before Script even looked at the first command, he had to know who was in charge of interpreting the message. On the very first line of his parchment, there was always a "Royal Seal" known as the Shebang.

#!/bin/bash

Think of the #! as a "Hey, look here!" and the /bin/bash as the address of the Grand Interpreter (Bash). Without this seal, the parchment was just a scrap of paper; with it, it became an official decree.

2. The Secret Whispers: Comments (#)
As Script walked through the kingdom, he sometimes saw lines on his parchment that started with a #.

# This part of the path is often muddy, watch your step!

These were Comments. The Grand Interpreter told Script to ignore anything following a #. They weren't commands for the computer; they were secret notes left by the parchment’s author to help future messengers understand why certain things were being done.

3. The Magic Jars: Variables
In Kernel-Land, messengers didn't like carrying heavy items, so they used Magic Jars called Variables. A variable is just a container with a name on the outside and a value on the inside.

To put something in a jar, you write: HERO_NAME="Sir Code-a-Lot"

When Script needed to use what was inside the jar, he had to use a special "key"—the dollar sign ($): echo "Welcome, $HERO_NAME"

Note: If you forget the $, Script will literally just say the word "HERO_NAME" instead of looking inside the jar to find "Sir Code-a-Lot."

4. The Town Crier: User Input (read)
Sometimes, Script’s parchment didn't have all the answers. He would need to stop a villager and ask for information. This is where the read command comes in.

echo "Halt! Who goes there?" read VISITOR_NAME

When Script hit the read command, he would pause, wait for the user to type something, and then catch that answer and stuff it into a new Magic Jar (variable) called VISITOR_NAME.

The Final Decree
When you put it all together, a simple day in the life of Script looks like this:

Bash

#!/bin/bash

# This script greets the heroes of Kernel-Land
GOLD_COINS=50

echo "What is your name, traveler?"
read TRAVELER

echo "Greetings, $TRAVELER! You have $GOLD_COINS coins in your pouch."
