shell Core Scripting Concepts
Every DevOps engineer should be proficient in fundamental shell scripting concepts, typically using Bash. 

    Basic Syntax: Understanding the shebang (#!/bin/bash), comments, variables, and user input (read).
    Control Flow: Using conditional statements (if-else, elif, case) and loops (for, while, until) for decision-making and iteration.
    Functions: Organizing reusable code blocks for modular and maintainable scripts.
    Input/Output Redirection: Managing data streams using >,>>, <, 2>, etc..
    Error Handling: Writing robust scripts using exit codes ($?), trap, set -e, and logging for reliable execution.
    Command-line Utilities: Proficiency with essential Linux commands for text processing and file manipulation (grep, awk, sed, cut, find, sort, uniq).
