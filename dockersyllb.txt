
Core Docker Concepts:

    Containerization Fundamentals:
    Understanding what containers are, their benefits, and how they differ from virtual machines.
    Docker Engine and Architecture:
    Knowledge of the Docker daemon, client, images, containers, registries (like Docker Hub), and volumes.
    Basic Docker Commands:
    Proficiency in commands for managing images (docker pull, docker build, docker push), containers (docker run, docker start, docker stop, docker rm), and volumes (docker volume create, docker volume ls).
    Docker Images and Dockerfiles:
    Creating custom Docker images using Dockerfiles, understanding common instructions (e.g., FROM, RUN, COPY, CMD, ENTRYPOINT), and optimizing image size.
    Docker Networking:
    Understanding different network drivers (bridge, host, overlay) and how containers communicate with each other and the outside world.
    Data Persistence:
    Managing data in containers using volumes and bind mounts to ensure data survives container lifecycles. 

Advanced Docker for DevOps:

    Docker Compose:
    Defining and running multi-container Docker applications using docker-compose.yml for local development and testing.
    Container Orchestration:
        Docker Swarm: Understanding Docker's native orchestration tool for deploying and managing a cluster of Docker nodes.
        Kubernetes (K8s): While not exclusively Docker, Kubernetes is the industry standard for container orchestration in production, and understanding its fundamentals (pods, deployments, services, ingress) is crucial for a DevOps role. 
    CI/CD Integration:
    Integrating Docker into continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or Azure DevOps to automate building, testing, and deploying containerized applications.
    Docker Security:
    Implementing security best practices for Docker images and containers, including image scanning, managing secrets, and configuring secure registries.
    Monitoring and Logging:
    Understanding how to monitor Docker containers and collect logs for troubleshooting and performance analysis using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack.
    Cloud Deployment:
    Deploying Dockerized applications to cloud platforms like AWS ECS, Azure AKS, or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). 

Prerequisites & Related Skills:

    Linux Fundamentals:
    A solid understanding of Linux command-line operations is essential as Docker is heavily used in Linux environments.
    Version Control (Git):
    Proficiency in Git for managing source code and Dockerfiles.
    Scripting:
    Basic scripting skills (e.g., Bash, Python) for automating Docker-related tasks.
    YAML:
    Understanding YAML syntax for configuring Docker Compose files and Kubernetes manifests.
